St. Of FAF-121 gr.: Caraganciu Dan 
Title
Advanced Form Elements. Child Windows. Basics of Working with Keyboard.
Contents
•	The Keyboard
•	Child Window Controls
•	Scroll Bar
•	Listbox
•	Menus and Other Resources
•	Dialog Boxes
Mandatory Objectives (completed)
•	Display a dialog box on some event.
•	Add a system menu to your application with at least 3 items.
•	Add a scroll bar that will change any visible parameter of any other element.
•	Hook keyboard input. Add 2 custom events for 2 different keyboard combinations.
Objectives with Points (completed)
•	Add a listbox and attach some events when any element is accessed (double-clicked). (2 pt.
•	Add 2 scroll bars that will manage main window size or position. (1 pt.)
•	Customize your application by adding an icon and using different cursor in application. (1 pt.)
•	Use a scroll bar to scroll through application working space. Scroll should appear only when necessary. (1 pt.)


Creating the application
•	In order to create this application I’ve read almost all chapters from the book ("Programming Windows, 5th Edition", by Charles Petzold) During the process I consult the documentation on the MSDN page and Win32 Tips & Tricks.
•	I tried to create something new which hasn’t been done before.
•	This application continues the same topic “Red Pill & Blue Pill”.The application has two text labels, two  input fields , and 8 buttons ( Reset button 1, Reset button 2, ADD button1, ADD button 2, REMOVE 1 and REMOVE button  2,Red button, Blue button ), two static labels, five scrollbars (which change the height and the width of the window and the background color), two traversal scrollbars, the main menu (file, view, help).
•	In order to understand more clearly I came up with this mockup :

Conclusions
First of all I can say that this laboratory work was very interesting for me, doing all this tasks made me  proud of my work because I’ve tried to manage all the features as good as possible. 
I tried to understand all concepts of manipulation of Menus, keyboard, dialog boxes, listboxes, etc  using additional information. It was challenging to complete all the tasks, I really enjoyed performing all of them. My goal was to extend my idea about red and blue pills. This laboratory work broadened and deepened my understanding of Event-Driven Programming, message-sending, and Win32 API in particular.
