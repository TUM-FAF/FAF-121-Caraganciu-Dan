Conclusions
-----------

This was my first laboratory work based on C# language.I used the Visual Studio IDE and Windows Forms Application, which made my work much easier. I used drag and drop options in order to create the GUI and all buttons. This feature of Visual Studio IDE is very convenient because you have to write only code for actions, not for buttons. The functions which I implemented in C# are pretty simple; they are basically all build in. I didnâ€™t encounter any problems while doing this laboratory work.
